        <h1>Mark's Journey - A Tale of Inspiration</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time in Kenya's small town,<br>
          Lived a boy named Mark, his dreams unwound.<br>
          Computers were his love, his heart's desire,<br>
          But resources were scarce, he faced a tough mire.
        
        </p>
        <p>In his public school, a single computer stood,<br>
          Old and forgotten, in the library it would brood.<br>
          Mark, intrigued by this machine of wonder,<br>
          Stayed after school, his passion growing fonder.
        
        </p>
        <p>Books and magazines became his loyal guides,<br>
          He taught himself typing, the internet's tides.<br>
          With BASIC, he wrote simple programs anew,<br>
          Mark's determination, strong and true.
        
        </p>
        <p>Dreaming of becoming a programmer, he yearned,<br>
          But obstacles loomed, and lessons had to be learned.<br>
          No computer at home, no mentors to inspire,<br>
          Yet Mark's spirit burned, a fierce inner fire.
        
        </p>
        <p>Then, a ray of hope shone through the gloom,<br>
          Code for Africa, a program to consume.<br>
          Free courses and mentorship, a dream come alive,<br>
          Mark's heart soared, ready to take a dive.</p>
        <p>Accepted into the program, he felt sheer bliss,<br>
          A laptop and modem, treasures not to miss.<br>
          Nairobi's mentor, wise and skilled,<br>
          Guided Mark through languages, his hunger filled.
        
        </p>
        <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python's might,<br>
          Mark learned eagerly, day and night.<br>
          Students from diverse lands, a community formed,<br>
          Passion and curiosity, their minds all warmed.
        
        </p>
        <p>The magic of coding dazzled Mark's sight,<br>
          Websites and apps, problems they'd ignite.<br>
          Ideas expressed, people brought together,<br>
          Open source projects, learning that would tether.</p>
        <p>Months flew by, Mark toiled with all his might,<br>
          Completing the program, his future shining bright.<br>
          A certificate, a letter from his mentor dear,<br>
          A portfolio of projects, his accomplishments clear.</p>
        <p>With newfound skills, Mark charted his way,<br>
          A freelance web developer, come what may.<br>
          Remote work from his hometown, he would tread,<br>
          While teaching coding, helping dreams to spread.</p>
        <p>Mark, the boy who became a programmer, they'd say,<br>
          Overcoming challenges, following his own way.<br>
          With skills and creativity, making the world anew,<br>
          Happy and proud, his dreams he did pursue.</p>
        <p>In Kenya's small town, a tale of inspiration,<br>
          Mark's journey, a testament to determination.<br>
          For he proved that dreams, when fueled by fire,<br>
          Can elevate lives, and lift hopes higher.</p>
